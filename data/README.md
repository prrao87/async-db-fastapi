# Dataset: 130k wine reviews

We use this [wine reviews dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zynicide/wine-reviews) as input. The data consists of 130k wine reviews with the variety, location, winery, price, description, and some other metadata provided for each wine. Refer to the Kaggle source for more information on the data.

The data is converted to a ZIP achive, and the code for this as well as the ZIP data is provided here for reference. There is no need to rerun the code to reproduce the results in the rest of the code base in this repo.
